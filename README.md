# empikWebScraper
Useful tool written in Python made for myself. Web scraper for empik.com ecommerce - Finds and sorts the best deals.
The program generates a pdf file with links to the best sorted deals.

The program was useful to make some money. 
For example: gave me the opportunity to buy board game called "Scottie Go!" very cheap (by the way a very good programming learning game for kids).
I bought over 100 pieces of this game and sold with 100 PLN net profit per unit.

needed libraries / packets:
```
pip install urlopen
pip install lxml
pip install fpdf
```

you need to have font file in program directory (uft-8 font)
```
DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf
```

Feel free to use it as you wish.
